- title: "Infinite-Task Learning with Vector-Valued RKHSs"
  abstract: Machine learning has witnessed the tremendous success of solving tasks depending on a hyperparameter. While multi-task learning is celebrated for its capacity   			  to solve jointly a finite number of tasks, learning a continuum of tasks for various loss functions is still a challenge. A promising approach, called  			  Parametric Task Learning, has paved the way in the case of piecewise-linear loss functions. We propose a generic approach, called Infinite-Task Learning, to 			  solve jointly a continuum of tasks via vector-valued RKHSs. We provide generalization guarantees to the suggested scheme and illustrate its efficiency in cost-			  sensitive classification, quantile regression and density level set estimation.

- title: "Approximate Kernel Methods and Learning on Aggregates"
  abstract: While a typical supervised learning framework assumes that the inputs and the outputs are measured at the same levels of granularity, many applications only have access to outputs at a much 			  coarser (aggregate) level. Kernel embeddings of distributions are well established as useful tools for fully nonparametric hypothesis testing, but they also found applications in learning and 			  predicting on distributional inputs corresponding to such aggregate outputs. I will describe the use of large-scale approximations to kernel embeddings in the context of Bayesian approaches to 			  learning on aggregates, as well as a variational approach using Gaussian processes and its application in fine-scale spatial modelling of disease.
